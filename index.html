                I am a fourth year computer science student at Westmont College.
                I built this website from scratch and you can see the code
                <a href="https://github.com/ethandvaughan/PersonalWebsite">here</a>
                on GitHub. I chose not to use react or bootstrap here as a
                challenge for myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working for the Center for Applied Technology at
                Westmont as a Salesforce Developer. I have worked primarily on
                building lightning web components for the application page for
                Westmont's new nursing program.
            </p>

                Outside of work and school I spend most of my time climbing,
                training, learning about climbing, or planning future climbs.
                My most recent climbing accomplishment was climbing Snake Dike
                on Half Dome in Yosemite. If you'd like to read more about how
                that went you can do so
