    <h3>Snake Dike</h3>

    <h4>May 4, 2022</h4>
    <p>After finishing up the semester in San Francisco, my girlfriend Ashley and I drove home to Auburn to spend the
      night
      before driving down to Yosemite for a few days. We packed our bags for a two night backpacking and climbing trip.
    </p>
    <h4>May 5, 2022</h4>
    <p>The drive down went well and we got into the park at about 5:00pm. We went to the wilderness center next the the
      Village Store and got our wilderness permit to stay in the Little Yosemite Valley campground. We began our hike
      around 6:00pm. We cruised to the mist trail and got absolutely soaked walking up to Vernal Falls. We didn't spend
      much time at the falls before continuing the hike, and just as we were leaving we ran into a guy from UC Berkeley
      that would visit his girlfriend in the San Francisco house often. The hike up to Nevada Falls was brutal. Each of
      our packs weighed about 30 pounds and the trail was so steep the entire time. Eventually we made it to the falls
      and knew that it was going to be smooth sailing from there. We made it into camp around 8:00pm. I set up my tent
      as Ashley set up her hammock and then we made (something) for dinner. We got to bed early in preparation to wake
      up early the next morning.</p>
    <h4>May 6, 2022</h4>
    <p>We woke up at about 5:00am and began to make oatmeal for breakfast and get our gear ready, a 70m rope, some BD
      C4s .3-3,a set of BD nuts, 4 extended draws, 2 slings, and some extra draws and biners. As I was heating the water
      for the oatmeal I realized that our gas can was nearly empty and this was probably its last bit of fuel (it was).
      After we ate I took the rope on my back and Ashley had our backpack for food, we both put our harness on and
      clipped the gear we needed. We knew where to go to find the climbers trail because we had found it the night
      before. The first half of the trek to the climb was through semi-thick forest with only a minimal trail and cairns
      to follow. After we got off the forest floor we found ourselves in some class 3/4 hiking up to the base of the
      climb. The weather was great and we were alone on the trail. We got to the climb around 7:15am we decided to take
      a little break and eat some snacks before starting. As we were snacking two other climbers, Mark and Bill, reached
      the base of the climb as well. Bill said he had done the climbing half a dozen times and was taking Mark on it for
      the first time. Bill gave us some beta and we let them go first. After Mark left the top of the first pitch we
      began our climb. </p>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pitch 1 (5.7):</h5>
    <p>Some no holds slab climbing to start helped build confidence in my shoes. I did as Bill suggested
      and climbed up on the right below a roof where I placed my first nut in a small crack, I traversed
      left below a golden section of slicker rock and then went straight up to the roof where I could place
      my next piece, an extended #3. I continued left and around the roof, placed a #1 and made my way to
      the belay. Mark was belaying at the next pitch and told me to traverse right before heading up to the
      first bolt.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pitch 2 (5.7):</h5>
    <p>I did what Mark said and made my way up the second pitch, followed a shallow crack up to a pair of
      bolts, clipped one and traversed right along the crack to some slab climbing, I placed a #.75 and
      made my way up the slab to the next belay station. By the time Ashley made it to me Bill and Mark
      we're well ahead of us.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pitch 3 (5.7):</h5>
    <p>This was by far the most difficult pitch on the entire route. No individual move was that difficult
      in itself, but it was mentally exhausting. I started the pitch by going up a bit then began the
      friction traverse left to a bolt I saw. Each step I took was onto the slightest dishes on what felt
      like a 70-80º slope. After a few steps I saw a bolt well below me and remembered what Bill had told me
      about this pitch, “don't go up, just go straight left to a bolt then continue to the dike”. Thanks Bill.
      As I went further the distance between the bolt and I got bigger and bigger. If one of my very sketchy
      feet were to slip I would pendulum swing and slide against sharp granite for quite some time. I eventually
      made it to the dike, clipped a bolt and climbed the 50 feet of 5.4 without protection to the belay station.
      Since I went off route and clipped a bolt that meant that Ashley had to do the same. She made it up to the
      bolt, unclipped, then down climbed about 5 feet to the easier traverse and cruised up to me.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pitch 4 (5.5):</h5>
    <p>Next up was about 60 feet of runout dike climbing to a bolt (optional belay) and then another 100 feet of
      runout to the belay station. The most runout pitch probably, I faced it by just not thinking about a fall
      and focusing on controlled solid movements.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pitch 5 (5.6):</h5>
    <p>Ashley had just made it up to the belay when a free soloist caught up with her and passed us, but not before
      asking where the route went (a bit concerning). At the beginning of this pitch the dike split and the route
      followed the right branch. There were a few features, a bolt and a crack that I could place a cam in, then a
      small 5.3 section to the next belay station.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pitch 6 (5.5):</h5>
    <p>Another very runout section of dike climbing with a few chicken heads I put slings on for protection. Just
      before the end of the route the dike disappeared and a bolt protects you for a small section of steep slab
      climbing.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pitch 7 (5.5):</h5>
    <p>In leaving the belay station I was also leaving the last pair of bolts on the route. Some easy friction
      climbing lead to a finger crack for gear and that lead up to a ledge where I built a belay anchor.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pitch 8 (5.5):</h5>
    <p>The last and likely the easiest pitch of the route due to the low angle and abundance of features to grab
      and place gear. At the top of the pitch I built a belay anchor in a large alleyway made of granite.</p>

    <p>Ashley made it up to me around 2:30pm and we took a little rest, ate a snack, and enjoyed the view. I racked
      everything away on my harness and tied the rope up, but we were far from done climbing. We climbed the 800 foot
      route, but had about 1,000 more feet of absolutely draining low angle slab climbing. For the first 100 feet or so
      a slip could have been near deadly. Towards the top I had to take a break about every 70 feet to let my calves
      rest for a minute. Once at the top we could see the familiar view and landscape of the top of Half Dome. We had to
      walk through some thin snow to get to where we wanted to eat and rest. For the first 10-15 minutes we were up
      there we were all alone. The sky was clear, the sun was bright, and the temperature was perfect. If not for my
      aching body that moment would have been perfect. After resting for a minute and eating lunch, a small group of
      guys were making it to the top of the cable route. We talked to them for a minute, got pictures for each other and
      began the descent down the cables together at about 4:15pm. I went in the front with Ashley behind me. I put on a
      pair of gloves, clipped my PA to a cable, and began to descend. This part was pretty sketchy considering that if
      one person were to fall they would drag the cable down the side of the cliff and slide down taking everyone else
      out with them. We would all be attached to the cable still, but would be sliding down the rock very quickly. I
      made it to the bottom and watched everyone else carefully make their way down. </p>

    <p>Ashley and I then began the hike back to our campsite. The hike was all downhill and very pleasant. The trail was
      nearly empty the whole time. After the 3 mile hike we made it to the campsite and got ready to start dinner. </p>

    <p>In the morning we had used the last bit of gas we had left for our camping stove and we needed to heat up some
      water for dinner. We gathered some sticks and small logs and I made a fire. Attempting to heat up the water
      without either getting ash in the pot or making the handle too hot to touch was tough but I eventually did it and
      we had salmon and ramen for dinner. After re-filling the water at the river we headed to bed.</p>

    <h4>May 7, 2022</h4>
    <p>We weren't really in a rush to get out in the morning so we took our time taking down the tent and packing
      everything away before leaving. We ended up leaving the campsite around 10:00am and made it to the car about 2 and
      a half hours later. We got some food at the Yosemite Village store and drove to the base of El Cap to look for
      climbers. Then left the park. The drive back was smooth and relaxing. Once we got home though I had to pack up the
      car to drive down to Santa Barbara the next day. Ashley was going to stay at home another night and have my mom
      drive her to the airport so she could see her family for a bit before meeting me down in Santa Barbara.</p>


    <p>The whole trip was very quick and a bit exhausting, but it was a great experience and I will definitely be
      climbing snake dike again someday.</p>
